    <p>Hello! This is my site. I am Nick, a hacker, coder, programmer, software engineer, fullstack, etc. etc. etc.
        whatever you are supposed to call it these days</p>
    <p>I decided to make a personal website and make a blog, I guess to follow the trend of every other guy that gets
        bored after 8 or so years experience and wants to do a blog.</p>

    <p>My github is <a href="https://github.com/NickalasLight">here</a>, working on some cool stuff, will have some cool
        ways to demo them here soon</p>

    <p>Best way to contact me is by email: <a href="mailto:nickalas.93@gmail.com">nickalas.93@gmail.com</a>,
        or by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickalaslight/">linkedin</a></p>
